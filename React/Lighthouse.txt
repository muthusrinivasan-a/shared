Optimize Images

Minimize JavaScript
Reduce JavaScript Bundle Size: Split large JavaScript bundles using techniques like code splitting to reduce the amount of JS loaded on the initial page.
Defer or Async JavaScript: Use defer or async attributes on scripts to prevent them from blocking page rendering.
Tree Shaking: Remove unused JavaScript code from your bundles to reduce the overall size of the scripts.
Minify JavaScript: Use minification tools like Terser to remove unnecessary characters (like spaces, new lines) from the JS code, making it smaller and faster to download.
